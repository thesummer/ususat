\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Provides a helper class for \-Scoped \-Mutexes. 

\-Create this object by passing a reference to a \hyperlink{class_u_s_u_1_1_lock}{\-Lock} object. \-It will lock the mutex when created and unlock it when destroyed, i.\-e. when going out of scope at the end of the \char`\"{}\}\char`\"{}. \-Can make it more convenient than manual (un)locking.

\-T\-O\-D\-O\-: \-Test if it works correctly with a getter-\/method
