 \brief Abstract wrapper class for a periodic thread usign the pthread library with RT-priority

 Based on RtThread this class uses pthread underneath but creates a periodic timer
 event it can wait for in a (forever) loop. This is more accurate than the use of
 nanosleep as the execution time of the loop will not be taken into account. It is
 therefore designed for periodic work where high accuracy is desired.
